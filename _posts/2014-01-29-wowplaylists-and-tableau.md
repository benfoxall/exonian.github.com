Recently at work I started organising the return of a tradition called [Welcome Playlists][wowp], where new staff get to
create a playlist for the office to listen to on a Friday afternoon shortly after they start; for those weeks where
there isn't anybody new starting, it's names out of a hat time to see who gets to have a go.
  
And then, inspired by [Andy][andy]'s [blog posts about visualising Last.fm data][andyBlogPost], I decided to
[fetch the playlist metadata][playviz] and play around with it in Tableau.

Below is the result of my first (really rather quick) effort at doing so:
