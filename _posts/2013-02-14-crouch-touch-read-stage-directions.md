Watching each game of the Six Nations this year, I keep getting drawn
back to one particular feature: the scrum; more precisely, the
refereeing of the scrum.

A few years ago (2007- I checked), the laws of rugby union were changed
to make the scrum safer: refs now had to ensure that the two front rows
were within touching distance of each other before they, after a pause,
came together.  Which is fine; what I've never understood is *how* the
refs had to go about refereeing this.  What they had to do was give a
series of instructions:

> "Crouch, Touch, Pause, Engage"

Now, I had no problem with the first two parts: "crouch" gets the packs
down into position, and "touch" makes sure they are close enough to
touch each other, which makes the "engage" step safer.  The bit I never
understood was the "pause"...  Now, this wasn't *a pause*, this was the
referee *saying the word "pause"*.  Given that the refs always delivered
each instruction with a gap in between, you ended up with

> "Crouch" *pause* "Touch" *pause* "Pause" *pause* "Engage"

which seemed to me to have two main effects:

1.  Make the ref sound like a sitcom character who has to read from a
script and ends up reading the stage directions in with the dialogue
2.  Slow the scrum down far more than was necessary, resulting in lots
of collapsed scrums.

## All better now

So, back to this year's Six Nations... well, the law has been changed
again (it's in a trial stage at the moment, I believe) to make the
instructions

> "Crouch, Touch, Set"

Ah, that's *better*.

No more pantomime, and scrums that aren't held up so long before they
come together that they collapse before the ball even arrives.
